<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>
Look at the project documents:

1. Concept Document - `@docs/1.4_concept.md`
2. System Architecture Document - `@docs/2_system_architecture.md`

Your task is to create the feature roadmap based on the above documents:

- Split all the work into phases (without detailed epics, steps and tasks) with details for each app layer (frontend, backend, integrations, etc.)
- Do not create a detailed plan. I just need a high-level roadmap - without detailed tasks, acceptance criterion, etc.
- Do not put time estimates.

Use the template `docs/3_feature_roadmap.md` as a reference.
