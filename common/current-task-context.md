Extract the current phase and step number from #ARGUMENTS and use it as <phase_number> and <step_number> in the file paths below.

The <phase_number> is the first number after word "phase" (e.g. "phase 2", "phase 3", etc)
The <step_number> consists both of epic number and a number of the step in the epic (e.g. "step 2.1", "step 2.2", etc).

If you have managed to parse and extract the numbers, you must print it explicitly in the output as:
Current phase: <phase_number>
Current step: <step_number>

If you have not managed to parse and extract the phase and step numbers, you must print that you could not parse and retry 2 times. Stop execution of the whole task after the second failed attempt and notify me.
